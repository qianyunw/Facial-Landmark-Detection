            Encode pixel coordinates relative to shape.

            In [1] relative encoding is used for approximations of landmark positions of evolving shapes. Pixel locations / intensities
            used as input for decision trees are chosen with respect to the mean shape of training samples. To warp these locations
            to the current shape estimate a crude approximation is performed by a single similarity transform in addition to local
            translations.

            For each absolute pixel coordinate this method looks up the nearest landmark and computes its relative offset.

            by a face detector) and the unit rectangle, use estimateSimilarityTransform to
